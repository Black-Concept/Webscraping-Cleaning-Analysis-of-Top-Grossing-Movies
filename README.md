# Webscraping-Cleaning-Analysis-of-Top-Grossing-Movies

### Project summary
This project explores the concept of websraping for extraction of tabular data from a wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films) which is mostly dirty data.

### Actions
I extracted the data from the HTML website using the Pandas function for reading html files and then subsetted the top grossing movies table from the html file.

The table was really dirty as it had some columns named wrongly, some had wrong data types which would not be good enough for quantitative analysis, some of the data also had special characters in them. The data was cleaned.

### Brief Insights from the data
Lastly, the data was analysed to get insights which are summarised below:
1. The top 50 grossing movies of all time all fall within three decades- 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s
2. The top grossing movie of all time is Avatar in 2009, closely followed by Avengers Endgame in 2019
3. The year that grossed the highest was 2019: 1.243737e+10 and the least year is 1999: 1.027083e+09 which is not surprising at all. The number of onscreen time has been rising progressively as suggested by other data and this is reflecting in the surge from the 2010s till date.
