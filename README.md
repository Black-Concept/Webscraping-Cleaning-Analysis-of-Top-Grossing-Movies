# Webscraping-Cleaning-Analysis-of-Top-Grossing-Movies

### Project summary
This project embarked on a journey to extract, clean, and analyze data from Wikipedia's list of highest-grossing films. Through webscraping and data manipulation techniques, a dataset of top-grossing movies was obtained and refined. Analysis revealed insights including the dominance of films from the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, with "Avatar" and "Avengers: Endgame" standing out as the top earners. Additionally, a progressive increase in box office earnings over time underscored the evolving landscape of cinematic success.

### Actions
Data Extraction: I utilized the Pandas library's HTML parsing functionality to extract the data directly from the webpage. From there, I isolated the table containing the top-grossing movies by indexing the table I wanted, effectively filtering out the extraneous information.

Data Cleaning: The extracted table proved to be quite messy, featuring mislabeled columns, improper data types unsuitable for quantitative analysis, and the presence of special characters within the data. Consequently, I undertook a thorough cleaning process to rectify these issues and ensured the integrity of the dataset.

### Key Findings
Upon analysis, several key insights emerged from the data:
1. The top 50 highest-grossing movies of all time are distributed across three distinct decades - the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, showcasing the enduring popularity of films across different eras.

2. Leading the pack as the highest-grossing movie of all time is "Avatar," released in 2009, closely trailed by "Avengers: Endgame" in 2019, demonstrating the cinematic prowess of these blockbuster hits.

3. In terms of annual gross earnings, 2019 emerges as the standout year, boasting a staggering total of 1.243737e+10. Conversely, the year 1999 records the lowest gross earnings, standing at 1.027083e+09. This disparity is unsurprising, given the progressive rise in onscreen entertainment over the years, with the surge particularly evident from the 2010s onwards.

### Conclusion and Future Recommendations
In conclusion, this project delved top-grossing movies of all time, unraveling insights through webscraping, data cleaning, and analysis. By navigating the complexities of Wikipedia's dataset, I unearthed patterns spanning decades, revealing the enduring appeal of cinematic masterpieces from the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.

My findings spotlighted iconic films such as "Avatar" and "Avengers: Endgame" as leaders of the box office. Furthermore, the progressive rise in box office earnings underscored the evolving landscape of cinematic consumption, reflecting societal shifts and technological advancements.

Looking ahead, the project paves the way for future analyses exploring genre dynamics, the influence of directors and studios, regional market trends, and the interplay between critical reception and box office success. By continuing to unravel the intricacies of the film industry, we can get invaluable insights to inform strategic decisions and shape the cinematic landscape for years to come.

### Visualization
I did a little visualisation in Tableau to visulize the data
